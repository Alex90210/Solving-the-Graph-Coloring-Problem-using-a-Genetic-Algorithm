Things to try:
    - random mutation + penalty fitness
    - corrective mutation (with a probability rate, otherwise the penalties will not be applied) + penalty fitness
    - insert new chromosomes with the current best colorization in mind. All the other chromosomes should be
    normalized such that no number(=color) is skipped.

------------------------------------------------

1. SELECTION:
    - WHEEL OF FORTUNE
2. MUTATION:
    - CORRECTIVE MUTATION ON CONFLICTING COLORS
    - RANDOM MUTATION ON CONFLICTING COLORS
3. CROSSOVER:
    - 100% CX PROBABILITY CROSSOVER
    - ADJUSTABLE CX PROBABILITY CROSSOVER
    - CROSSOVER BY FITNESS VALUE
    - ADJUSTABLE CROSSOVER RANDOM SHUFFLE
4. EVALUATION:
    - BY COLOR FITNESS
    - BY CONFLICT FITNESS

0.0 Correction operator?
0.1 Penalty Evaluation
    - for each conflict, add a penalty equal to the worst number of colors (the chromatic number)
EXAMPLE: 50 vertices, 14 colors, 2 conflicts
         => Fitness = 114.
    - use both a penalty and a correction operator
